# Emoji8

![Emoji8 logo](Emoji8/Assets/emoji8Smaller.png)

## Overview

This sample shows you how you can use [Windows Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/winmldocsfromemoji8oss) to power a fun emotion-detecting application.

Emoji8 is sample UWP application that evaluates your facial expressions while you imitate a random selection of emojis. The app takes in a video feed from your computer's webcam and evaluates the images with the [FER+ Emotion Recognition model (version 1.2)](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/body_analysis/emotion_ferplus) locally on your machine. You can tweet a gif summarizing your best scoring pics when you have an internet connection and continue playing even when you don't have one!

This app will give you a great end-to-end example of how you can use the Windows ML APIs to create simple yet magical experiences.


## Assumptions
   This sample assumes you have the following installed/established:

1. Windows 10 October 2018 Update [1809]
1. Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.7.4+) with Windows 10 SDK Build 17763
1. A Twitter developer account (if you want to enable the "Share to Twitter" feature)
1. A front-facing camera connected to your computer

## Steps to run the sample

1. Load the `Emoji8.sln` into Visual Studio.

1. _(Optional)_ Enable the "Share to Twitter" feature with the Windows Community Toolkit [Twitter Service](https://aka.ms/twitterserviceredirectfromemoji8oss).
    1. [Register](https://apps.twitter.com/) your local sample as a Twitter app.  
    1. Locate and copy your generated Twitter:
        * Consumer Key
        * Consumer Secret
        * Callback URL
    1. Paste the above credentials in the their corresponding empty Twitter strings in the `Constants.cs` file.
1. _(Optional)_ Remove the Dev Center logging. This non-personal data is only successfully transmitted when playing a Store-published version of the app, so running this OSS code locally will not actually collect any data.    
    1. Uninstall the `Microsoft.Services.Store.Engagement` NuGet package.
    1. Remove Microsoft Engagement Framework from the project References.
    1. Delete the following 2 lines in the `Constants.cs` file:

        ```cs
        using Microsoft.Services.Store.Engagement;
        ```

        ```cs
        public static StoreServicesCustomEventLogger LOGGER = StoreServicesCustomEventLogger.GetDefault();
        ```

    1. Delete the following line in the `MainPage.xaml.cs` file:

        ```cs
        Constants.LOGGER.Log(GameText.LOADER.GetString("LoggerStartButtonClicked"));
        ```

    1. Lastly, delete the following 7 lines in the `ResultsPage.xaml.cs` file:

        ```cs
        Constants.LOGGER.Log(GameText.LOADER.GetString("LoggerPlayAgainClicked"));
        ```

        ```cs
        Constants.LOGGER.Log(GameText.LOADER.GetString("LoggerShareToTwitterClicked"));
        ```

        ```cs
        Constants.LOGGER.Log($"{GameText.LOADER.GetString("LoggerShareToTwitterError")} {ex.Message}");
        ```

        ```cs
        Constants.LOGGER.Log(GameText.LOADER.GetString("LoggerContinuePostingYesClicked"));
        ```

        ```cs
        Constants.LOGGER.Log(GameText.LOADER.GetString("LoggerContinuePostingNoClicked"));
        ```

        ```cs
        Constants.LOGGER.Log(GameText.LOADER.GetString("LoggerPostTweetCancelClicked"));
        ```

        ```cs
        Constants.LOGGER.Log(GameText.LOADER.GetString("LoggerPostTweetClicked"));
        ```

1. Build and run the solution.
1. Enjoy! :)
